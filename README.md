Hello, this is a simple didactic repository that aims to create a fetch API wrapper
with typings and extensible with plugins.

## Repo rules

- Everything must be tested
- Commits should be done using `npm run commit`
- Styleguide is enforced

## Tools

The repo is growing in some tools, the commiting part is taken by `better-commits` package and
the branching is taken by `better-branch`, you just need to use `npm run commmit` or `npm run branch` to use them.

Testing is taken by `vitest` and building by `vite`.

That's it for the moment
